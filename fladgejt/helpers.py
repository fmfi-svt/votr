    Structure keys (see :func:`keyed_namedtuple`) are tuples of strings, but we
    want the client to see plain strings, to simplify client-side code and to
    enforce the keys' opaqueness. When a keyed namedtuple is sent to the client,
    we encode the key as a string, and when the client does an RPC call of some
    client method, we decode the strings back into tuples of strings. Thus, we
    need to know which arguments should be decoded and which shouldn't (they
    really are just strings). That can be specified using this decorator::

        @with_key_args(True, True, False)
        def some_method(self, some_key, another_key, normal_argument):
            ...

        ``True`` if it's a key and should be decoded, and ``False`` otherwise.
